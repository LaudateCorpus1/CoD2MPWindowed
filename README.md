# [Call of Duty 2 Multiplayer (Windowed)](https://www.si13n7.com/Downloads/Gaming%20Tools/Call%20of%20Duty%202%20Windowed/)

A friend told me about the missing windowed mode for Call of Duty 2 and that he tries to fix it with reverse engineering.

It was a good reason to check out what we can do. I'm always interested in finding solutions... even for a creepy old game...

## How does it work?

~~It's very simple for Windows 10. I was really wondering but it's enough to create a form application and~~ change the parent of the game. Then you only have to handle the resize functions for great flexibility.

~~The fix is similiar for older Windows versions.~~ But before we can do that we have to change 2 bytes in 'gfx_d3d_mp_x86_s.dll' to force windowed mode.

To prevent md5 mismatch issues in PunkBuster it creates copies for 'CoD2MP_s.exe' and 'gfx_d3d_mp_x86_s.dll' for patching. The copied 'CoD2MP_s.exe' gets a patch to load the patched copy of 'gfx_d3d_mp_x86_s.dll' instead of the original.
